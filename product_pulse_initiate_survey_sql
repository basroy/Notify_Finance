// Fetch all relevant fields from EDW, from a single table or multiple joins via joins
// Gather the data into temporary view or Common Table Expression, so that futher data manipulations will be done
// In this example, for simplicity a single table is used to build a single CTE. 
// Note that the single CTE could have been split up into separate CTES, each with a 'case' clause if tables used would have
// been more than the one and where table joins could have caused performance issue. 
// Tables from EDW when not properly indexed or not properly set up in star schema fashion would lead to cartesian product and very inefficient data fetch.

// Data cleansing in the CTE in the  'Where' clause is used to filter out values that will have NULL columns. 
//Data cleansing in the CTE via 'Case' clause. The value substitution to numerals will be used to rank the records.
// The two sets of ranking are used on all the CTE records.
// Fetch all customer records whwre each account will have multiple records , and thus rank them based on job-level 
// of the account executive and the product sales role.
// It is understood that higher the sales role in the historical data of the account, higher the ranking of the record.
// Fetch the records where the month of the IMpact_Purchase_Date is in multiples of 6 from current month, so that the eligible records are extracted every 6 months.
